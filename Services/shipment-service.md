# Shipment Service â€“ Microservice Documentation

**Responsibilities:**
- Validate and create shipments
- Assign drivers
- Check warehouse availability via WMS
- Publish `shipment_created` events to Kafka

**Technology Stack & DB Preference:**
- Language: Python
- Framework: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL (relational, strong ACID compliance)
- Messaging: Kafka for async events

## Integration Notes
- Micro Integrator calls this service via REST API
- Publishes Kafka event `shipment_created` for downstream services
- Stateless service; can scale horizontally
